# Audible-Summary-of-Long-form-YouTube-Content
In this project, we learnt how to use hugging face transformers, speech recognition, pipeline, etc to make a project that takes a YouTube video URL and takes its captions using YouTube transcripts or generates its captions using speech recogniser and summarizes the entire captions, converts it into an audio file making it easy for the user to go through a long video or long lectures by just listening to the summarized audio.
