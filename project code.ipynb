              "'[\" Class of 2017, congratulations! I\\'m an unlikely speaker, not just because I dropped out, but because we\\'re technically in the same generation . President Faust, Board of Overseers, faculty, alumni, proud parents, members of the ad board, and graduates of the greatest university in the world, I\\'m honored to be with you today .\", \" I swear getting into Harvard is still the thing my parents are most proud of me for . My best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla. I was late so I threw on a t-shirt inside out and backwards with my tag sticking out the front. I couldn\\'t figure out why no one would talk to me -- except one guy, KX Jin, he just went with it. We ended up doing our problem sets together, and now he runs a big part of Facebook.\", \" Harvard commencement speaker says he met Priscilla at Facemash party in line for bathroom in Pfoho. y party . He says it was the most important thing he built in his time at the university . He\\'s so grateful to Harvard for starting lifelong friendships with his friends and family .\", \\' The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose . Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we have something better ahead of us . Technology and automation are eliminating many jobs and membership in communities is declining .\\', \" Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook on the night he launched the social network . He says the idea was so clear to us that all people want to connect. We were just college kids. We didn\\'t know anything about that. There were all these big technology companies with resources. I just assumed one of them would do it. So we just kept moving forward .\", \" The first News Feed was built to connect more people with people around the world . But it\\'s not enough to have purpose yourself, you have to create a sense of purpose for others . LZ: My hope was never to build a company, but to make an impact. I thought if we could just launch this, it could change how we learn about the world.\", \\' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about three ways to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose . He says we need to take on big meaningful projects together, redefine equality so everyone has the freedom to pursue purpose, and by building community across the world . Zuckerberg: Our generation will have to deal with millions of jobs replaced by automation .\\', \" More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon . Millions of volunteers immunized children against polio. Millions of more people built the Hoover dam. Now it\\'s our turn to do great things. Ideas don\\'t come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started.\", \" In our society, we often don\\'t do big things because we\\'re so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing . The reality is, anything we do will have issues that can\\'t keep us from starting. So what are we waiting for? It\\'s time for our generation-defining public service. How about stopping climate change?\", \" We spend 50x more treating people who are sick than we spend finding cures so people don\\'t get sick in the first place . How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers to track their health data and share their genomes? Let\\'s do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role . The second is redefining equality to give everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose .\", \" An entrepreneurial culture thrives when it\\'s easy to try lots of new ideas, says Mark Zuckerberg . Culture of entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress, he says . But today, we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone, he adds . The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail, Zuckerberg says .\", \" We all know we don\\'t succeed just by having a good idea or working hard. We succeed by being lucky too. We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a role they find meaningful . Every generation expands its definition of equality. It\\'s our time to define a new social contract for our generation.\", \\' Chan Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan started the ChanZuckerberg Initiative to promote equal opportunity . Millennials are already one of the most charitable generations in history . Three of four US millennials made a donation in one year and seven out of ten raised money for charity . You can also give  a cushion to try new things, Zuckerberg says .\\', \" When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she became a teacher, she told me I needed to teach a class . She insisted, so I taught a middle school program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys and Girls Club . For five years now, I\\\\\\\\\\'92ve been having dinner with those kids every month . Next year they\\\\\\\\\\'92re going to college, all of them first in their families .\", \\' A survey asked millennials around the world what defines our identity, the most popular answer was \"citizen of the world\" That\\\\\\'s a big deal. For us, it now encompasses the entire world . Let\\\\\\'s give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose -- not only because it\\\\\\'s the right thing to do, but because more people can turn dreams into something great .\\', \" We get that our greatest opportunities are now global -- we can be the generation that ends poverty, that ends disease . Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community . But we live in an unstable time. There are people left behind by globalization. It\\'s hard to care about people in other places. There\\'s pressure to turn inwards. This is the struggle of our time.\", \" This isn\\'t going to be decided at the UN either. It\\'s going to happen at the local level, when we feel a sense of purpose and stability in our own lives that we can open up and start caring about everyone . The best way to do that is to start building local communities right now .\", \\' I met David Razu Aznar, a former city councilor in Mexico City, who fought to make Mexico City the first Latin American city to pass marriage equality . Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain started a non-profit that connects people suffering from illnesses with people in their communities willing to help . She trains thousands of law enforcement officers to keep communities safely .\\', \" One of his top students said he wasn\\'t sure he could go to college because he\\'s undocumented . He didn\\'t know if the country he calls home would deny him his dream of going to college . He wasn\\'t even thinking of himself. He has a greater sense of purpose, and he\\'s going to bring people along with him .\", \" The Class of \\'17 is graduating from Memorial Church in New Haven, Massachusetts, on Friday . It\\'s the first time I\\'ve heard from a high school senior who doesn\\'t know what the future holds . I hope you find the courage to make your life a blessing .\"]'"
